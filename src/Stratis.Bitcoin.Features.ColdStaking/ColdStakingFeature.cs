    /// <para>In order to produce blocks on Stratis network, a miner has to be online with running
    /// node and have its wallet open. This is necessary because at each time slot, the miner is
    /// supposed to check whether one of its UTXOs is eligible to be used as so-called coinstake kernel
    /// input and if so, it needs to use the private key associated with this UTXO in order to produce
    /// the coinstake transaction.</para>
    /// <para>The chance of a UTXO being eligible for producing a coinstake transaction grows linearly
    /// with the number of coins that the UTXO presents. This implies that the biggest miners on the
    /// network are required to keep the coins in a hot wallet. This is dangerous in case the machine
    /// where the hot wallet runs is compromised.</para>
    /// <para>Cold staking is a mechanism that eliminates the need to keep the coins in the hot wallet.
    /// With cold staking implemented, the miner still needs to be online and running a node with an open
    /// wallet, but the coins that are used for staking can be safely stored in cold storage. Therefore
    /// the open hot wallet does not need to hold any significant amount of coins, or it can even be
